# INFOF413 Assignment 2: Karger's Algorithm

Alexandre Achten, December 2024

## Experimentation

Different [graph families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphs) are tested with the algorithm. The families are listed here :

- Barbell graphs : To see how the algorithm handles bottleneck graphs
- Random graphs : Generated with Erdos Renyi model
- Complete graphs : Graphs where every vertices are connected to each other
-
